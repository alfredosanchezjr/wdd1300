    <p>Hi everyone!

        I'm Alfredo, just came back from my mission in Arequipa, Peru, and diving back into school. I'm the youngest in my family, with my mom and three sisters by my side. Rexburg has been our home for the past nine years, serving as a perfect launchpad for our travels. I love coding, creating in Adobe CC, photography, and exploring new places. Growing up in a Latino household has been my motivation for everything I do! My mom is from Guatemala, and my dad was from Mexico, so my sisters and I are the first in both families to graduate from high school and pursue a college degree. Growing up in a creatively encouraging environment, and finding my love for coding in high school, led me to major in Web Design and Development. It's a perfect blend of my interests! I'm super excited to be creative along side all of you and see your ideas come to life!</p>
